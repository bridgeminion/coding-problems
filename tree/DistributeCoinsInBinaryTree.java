/**
 * You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.
 *
 * In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [3,0,0]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [0,3,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves]. Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
